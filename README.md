## Introduction

**Hide Commands** is a simple and lightweight
[Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) plugin designed to enhance server
security and privacy by hiding commands from players who lack the necessary
permissions to use them. With this plugin, commands are concealed in such a way
that unauthorized players cannot determine whether a specific command exists or
not.
